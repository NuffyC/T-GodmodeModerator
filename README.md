# T-GodmodeModerator
A simple godmode detection plugin. 

Permissions:

- ac.gmwl
(Any group with this permisson will not get kicked if they have /godmode or other means of inf invulnerability)

Issues:

Currently i haven't found a way to detect dodges, which is rare but sometimes can result in a false postive. (would need to dodge for 10s straight in a row)
Haven't added a way to detect if a player has a cross necklace and intergrate that to the delay.
The parry mechanic may cause a flase positive.
Currently doesn't detect/work for pvp projectiles.
